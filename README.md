LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. Use these commands to get a result: concert-this, spotify-this-song, movie-this, do-what-it-says.

Using concert-this and the artist you choose it will pull up events for that artist.

Using spotify-this-song and a song it will show you information about that song.

Using movie-this and the movie it will show you information about that movie.

Using do-what-it-says will default to the song "I want it that way" and information about that song.
